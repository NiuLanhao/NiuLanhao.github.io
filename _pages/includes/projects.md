[Integrated Platform for Classic Text Translation and Learning Based on Large Language Models](https://github.com/NiuLanhao/classic_text_translation)

- The ChatGLM model was fine-tuned with *P-Tuning v2* to improve classical text translation. It includes a multilingual corpus from the ‚ÄúTwenty-Four Histories,‚Äù supporting translations among classical Chinese, English, and modern Chinese.
- A *RAG* system was developed using the *LlamaIndex framework* and a custom ‚ÄúXunzi‚Äù model. Additionally, a *WeChat mini-program* was created for mobile translation of classical texts.

[Rice Yield Prediction Based on UAV Imagery](https://github.com/NiuLanhao/rice_segmentation)

- Elevated detection precision by transitioning from the *YOLOv5* single-stage approach (accuracy 0.457) to the two-stage *Cascade R-CNN*, achieving an enhanced accuracy of *0.844*.
- Enhanced rice instance segmentation accuracy by shifting from *Mask R-CNN* (accuracy 0.601) to *Cascade R-CNN with integrated masks*, resulting in an improved accuracy of *0.71*.

[Zhipu Legal Charter: RAG-based Integrated Civil Law Platform](https://github.com/NiuLanhao/legal_rag)

- The project implemented *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* with the *Zilliz vector database* for case retrieval in civil litigation. An *inverted index* was used to enhance search functionality for users unfamiliar with legal terminology.
- A civil law awareness platform was developed using *Django* and *Vue*, featuring a web interface and administrative CRUD functionalities for a MySQL database.

[Momentum Analysis: The Movement of Tennis ](https://github.com/NiuLanhao/tennis_momentum_analysis)

- Data preprocessing utilized a *BP neural network* to extract eight features for player performance evaluation. An evaluation system linked player momentum to final victory using the *Kruskal-Wallis H test*.
- *MNN and RBP models* identified key indicators of match momentum, incorporating past data for improved suggestions. Performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 score, Accuracy) showed reliable score prediction.
