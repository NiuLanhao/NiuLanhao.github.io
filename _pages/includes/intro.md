I am Lanhao Niu (钮兰皓), a senior undergraduate student at [Nanjing Agricultural University](https://ai.njau.edu.cn/), majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology. With a deep passion for artificial intelligence and a solid foundation in diverse projects, I am currently an algorithm intern at [Zhipu AI](https://www.zhipuai.cn/), where I’m honing my skills in advanced AI applications.

My research interests span natural language processing, Large Language Model and knowledge graphs, focusing on how these technologies can be leveraged to solve real-world problems. I am particularly intrigued by the intersection of AI and data science, and how innovations in these fields can drive breakthroughs in various industries.

*I am actively seeking opportunities for a Master’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence starting in Fall 2025, aiming to deepen my expertise and contribute to cutting-edge AI research and development！！！*
